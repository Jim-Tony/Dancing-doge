# dancingdoge
This Webpage is used to generate Dancing doge in GIF format. I have used the basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. The stylesheet I have linked is from Bootstrap exclusively for the button tags. Click the below link for the stylesheet <br>
https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css <br>
On clicking the 'Click to see doge' button gives the GIF in the next container. You can delete each GIF by selecting reset button.
That's all for this, and I have used only basic CSS options.
